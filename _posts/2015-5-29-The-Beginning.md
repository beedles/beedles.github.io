"The Game" (so far the only title I have come close to giving it is "Twin Stick Shooter"...) was born out of a desire for a mash up of various genres. I have always enjoyed games that allow me to develop a character over time, learning new skills, getting new equipment, and defeating progressively harder enemies. Obviously this led me to love and play hundreds of hours in games like Ultima Online, Diablo (1, 2 and 3), Path of Exile, as well as many MOBA's including many hours in DOTA (in Warcraft 3) and DOTA 2. One gem that I've recently picked up again is Dawn of Magic, and it's this game that is the major inspiration.

Over time I plan to reveal various features (either implemented or planned) that I will have in it, however it is worth noting that I work full time and am expecting offspring in the near future which seriously limits development. With that said, I recently read an interesting reddit post ([Coding every day](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/37i77h/ive_been_writing_mostly_game_code_for_365_days/)) that suggests that coding every day (whether it be a comment, some refactoring, or entire functionality) can help build a good habit. So far I've managed 2 in a row! Eventually I'll utilise GitHubs commit tracker to help keep track of my coding so I'll even have something as proof...

Finally here is a gif from the latest build, recently I implemented some basic "lighting" including a "flickering" effect (albeit far too eratic). I intend to rework this next.
